                    RuleScript lets you write policy specifications that are simple, unambiguous, and are applied with utter consistency by a computer. It works by providing a framework for the following equation:
                </div>
                <code>
                    <div class="primaryHighlight features__body" style="text-align:center">
                        input documents + validation rules = pass/fail decision
                    </div>
                </code>
                <div class="features__body">
                    You write your rules in a simple computer language, point the rules at input document(s), and receive an instant, automatic answer about whether the input conforms to your rules.
                </div>
                <div class="features__body">
                    RuleScript is fast and flexible enough to save time on a one-week project. It's also built on industrial-strength software that can scale to hundreds of team members.

                    Computer languages don't have to be scary. RuleScript is easy to follow after a short primer on the ground rules. There's no math required, and no weird symbols to learn.

                    Once a policy is defined using RuleScript, it can instantly assess whether an input document conforms to the policy. Have thousands of documents? No sweat.
